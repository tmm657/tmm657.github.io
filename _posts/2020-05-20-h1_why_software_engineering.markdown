I didn't always want to get into software engineering.  I have a passion for printing,  paper and creating masterpieces for others.  Where I live there aren't a lot of opportunities to work in printing and I'm not one to settle for a job that I'm just going to be miserable at and loathe everyday. 
    I was in 6th grade when I started messing with html, trying to figure out what it all meant. I would update my MySpace and Xanga profiles by using the html format as opposed to just sticking to the templates. I really enjoyed figuring it out,  but at the time I didn't know how useful it really was.  After many nights of wondering what can I do for work that I won't hate,  that I can have an actual career in, where to go from here?  
		  I started out by downloading an app(grasshopper) on my phone to do something in my spare time. I would complete the levels as days went by and I found myself enjoying it so much I downloaded another app(mimo) and proceeded with my voluntary learning journey. I use these daily to help keep my mind fresh and I just do them in my spare time instead of playing a pointless game on my phone.  I stumbled upon an app called career karma and it peaked my interest entirely.  Through the career karma app I've stumbled upon another app(sololearn) and all these apps are great if you're wanting to learn code,  but career karma is what made me decide I wanted to be a software engineer and with all the tools and online community willing to help with such great resources to offer it was practically screaming out this is the job for you.  For those of you interested I will provide links for all apps at the end of this post. 
			 So here I am eager to pursue this journey and start my new career once school is over. Everyday is a learning process so I'm not sure who is ever truly over.
